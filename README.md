Note that the datasets used in this study are quite large (many GB to up to 1.1 TB) so most of this work was performed on the Harvard Medical School (HMS O2) computing cluster. Other parts of this script were written for a smaller, internal lab computing cluster. It is not expected to work on a personal computer.

Much of the phenotypic data used in this study comes from the Zoological Information Management System (ZIMS), which is managed by Species360 and available via a paid subscription and therefore cannot be made directly available by the authors of this study. 

Therefore, the code provided here is exactly what was run to perform these analyses but is not expected to run on another system without substantial modifications to ensure proper software, computational power, directory structures, and new phenotypic data files. Please reach out to me at aokamoto@g.harvard.edu if you wish to replicate these analyses and the provided code is insufficient. I will try to help you to the best of my abilities.
